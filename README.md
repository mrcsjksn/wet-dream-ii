# WET DREAM II
## for electric guitar, drum-kit, and electronics

The first thing I learnt to play on piano was a cover of Celine Dion’s _My Heart Will Go On_. My grandparents had bought me an electric piano, which had keys that would light up, showing you how to play different songs. This song was one of the pre-loaded tracks. 

_WET DREAM II_ follows in this line of karaoke performance and electronic pedagogy. The work draws on the history of rock music—specifically guitar and drum solos—in which the performers would riff climactically near the end of a song. 

The work is synthesised through the analysis of a database of YouTube videos, all chosen by searching “crazy drum/guitar solo” in the search bar. The audio of these videos is analysed, in a somewhat faulty attempt to create a meta-solo: the craziest rock solo ever, for each of the instruments. 

Music pedagogy on  YouTube is an interesting area of the internet. A large collection of videos allow musicians to learn the ways of their rock idols, detailing how to achieve various performance styles, both by how you play and what you are playing with. There are a number of tutorials on how to riff in various idioms, and evermore videos describing the instrument and pedal setups of one’s favourite performers. Naturally, the result is a large number of videos displaying the output of rock musicians on the internet: a kind of digital show-and-tell. 

Somewhere between documentation and caricature, _WET DREAM II_ suspends these rock solos by zooming in on their acoustic features and extrapolating them into a considerably longer work. The result is, as performers of the work have noted, a solo that goes on for too long, and then a little longer.
